"""
consolidate_library.py
======================

This script orchestrates the high‑level workflow for maintaining a Zotify
music library on macOS. It relies on helpers from ``library_manager`` to
update playlists from Spotify, synchronize duplicate files, merge multiple
music folders into one consolidated library, and produce a summary of
playlist status. The goal of this entry point is to match the behaviour
of the original ``consolidate_library.py`` while delegating the heavy
lifting to well‑named functions in separate modules.

Running this script will prompt you to optionally refresh your local
playlist files from Spotify, update your Zotify Music library for any
outdated songs, consolidate multiple source directories into a single
``Consolidated Library`` folder, and then display a summary of
incomplete and complete playlists. It also detects orphaned tracks,
offers to remove leftover songs, and ensures album artwork is resized
to a standard dimension.

Usage:

    python consolidate_library.py

Ensure your Spotify API credentials (SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID,
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET, SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI) are set in your
environment. The default redirect URI used here is
``http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`` which must match the settings in
your Spotify Developer Dashboard.

    After playlists have been updated and libraries consolidated, this
    function examines all ``.m3u8`` files in ``consolidated_library_dir``
    to determine which playlists have missing songs. It then prints
    incomplete playlists (including optional titles and links), lists
    complete playlists with their song counts, identifies orphan and
    leftover songs, and optionally removes leftover tracks.

    ----------

        subdirectories.
